GIN RUMMY RULES:
Setup: 52-card deck. Each player receives 7-10 cards (variant dependent). Remaining cards form draw pile.
Goal: Form melds (sets of 3+ same rank, or runs of 3+ consecutive cards in same suit) to minimize deadwood (unmelded cards).

Each turn:
1. Draw: Take top card from draw pile or discard pile
2. Discard: Place one card face-up on discard pile

Knocking: When deadwood ≤ knock_card value (8-10), you may knock to end the hand.
Gin: If all cards form melds (0 deadwood), declare "Gin" for bonus points.

Scoring: Winner scores difference in deadwood values. Gin earns 25-point bonus.
