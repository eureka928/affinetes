PIG DICE RULES:
Setup: 2 players, 1 six-sided die. Goal: First to reach target score (20-40 points) wins.

Each turn:
- Roll: Roll die and add to turn total. If you roll 1, lose turn total and turn ends.
- Hold: Add turn total to your permanent score and end turn.

Strategy: Balance risk (rolling for more points) vs. reward (holding to bank points).

Winning: First player to reach or exceed target score wins immediately.
