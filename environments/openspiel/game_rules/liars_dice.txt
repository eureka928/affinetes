LIAR'S DICE RULES:
Setup: Each player has N dice (1-5 depending on variant). All players roll their dice secretly.
Goal: Make bids about total dice across ALL players, or call "Liar" on opponent's bid.

Actions: 
- Bid (quantity, face): Claim there are at least 'quantity' dice showing 'face' among all dice.
- Call Liar: Challenge the previous bid.

Bidding rules: Each bid must be higher than the last (either higher quantity of same face, or same quantity of higher face). Highest face (6) is wild.

Winning: If you call Liar and previous bid was false, opponent loses. If bid was true or exact, you lose.
