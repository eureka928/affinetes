QUORIDOR RULES:
Board: 7×7 or 9×9 grid. 2-4 players, each starts at opposite edge with goal to reach opposite edge.
Goal: Be first to move your pawn to any square on opposite edge.

Each turn, choose ONE action:
- Move pawn: 1 square orthogonally (up/down/left/right). Can jump over adjacent pawn if no wall blocks.
- Place wall: Block 2 spaces between squares (horizontal or vertical). Limited walls per player (8-10).

Wall rules: Cannot completely block any player from reaching their goal edge.
Winning: First pawn to reach target edge wins.
Strategy: Balance advancing your pawn vs. blocking opponents with walls.
