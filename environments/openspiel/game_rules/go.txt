GO RULES:
Board: Grid (7×7, 9×9, or 11×11). 2 players (Black and White). Goal: Control more territory than opponent.

Turn: Place one stone on empty intersection. Once placed, stones don't move (unless captured).
Capture: Surround opponent's stones (remove all liberties/adjacent empty points) to capture and remove them.
Ko rule: Cannot immediately recapture to repeat previous board position.

Territory: Empty intersections surrounded by your stones. Scoring: Territory + captured stones + komi (bonus for White, typically 6.5-7.5 points).
Winning: Higher score wins.
