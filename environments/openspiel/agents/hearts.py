Setup: 4 players, 52-card deck. Deal 13 cards each. Goal: Avoid taking hearts and Queen of Spades (penalty cards).

Optional card passing: Before play, pass 3 cards to another player (variant dependent).

Play: Follow suit if possible. Highest card of led suit wins trick. Winner leads next trick.
Cannot lead hearts until hearts "broken" (someone discarded a heart).

Scoring: Each heart = 1 point, Queen of Spades = 13 points. Lowest score wins.
Shooting the moon: Take ALL penalty cards to give 26 points to each opponent instead."""
