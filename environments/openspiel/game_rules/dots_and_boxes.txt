DOTS AND BOXES RULES:
Board: Grid of dots (3×3, 4×4, or 5×5). Goal: Complete more boxes than opponent.

Turn: Draw one horizontal or vertical line between two adjacent dots.
Completing a box: When you draw the 4th side of a box, you claim it (mark with your initial) and take another turn.

Scoring: Each completed box = 1 point.
Strategy: Avoid giving opponent opportunity to complete boxes. Chain reactions possible in endgame.

Winning: Player with most completed boxes when all lines drawn wins.
