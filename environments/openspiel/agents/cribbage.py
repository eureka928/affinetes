Setup: 52-card deck. 2-4 players. Deal 5-6 cards per player. Goal: First to 121 points.
Each player discards cards to form the "crib" (bonus hand for dealer).

Play: Players alternate playing cards. Cannot exceed running total of 31. Score points for:
- Pairs (2 points), runs (1 per card), sum of 15 (2 points), sum of 31 (2 points).

Counting: After play, count hand + starter card for combinations (pairs, runs, 15s, flush).
Dealer also counts the crib.

Scoring is complex; points tracked on cribbage board (pegging)."""
