PHANTOM TIC-TAC-TOE RULES:
Like standard Tic-Tac-Toe, but with imperfect information: You CANNOT see opponent's moves.
Board: 3×3 grid. Players alternate placing X or O.
Goal: Form 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

Key difference: When you try to place on a cell occupied by opponent, move fails silently or you get limited feedback (variant dependent).
Observation variants:
- "reveal-nothing": No feedback on opponent moves
- "reveal-numturns": Know how many turns opponent took

Winning: First to get 3 in a row wins.
